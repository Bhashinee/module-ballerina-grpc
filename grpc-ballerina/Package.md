## Package Overview

The gRPC library is one of the standard library modules of the [Ballerina language](https://ballerina.io/).

This provides support for the gRPC messaging protocol. gRPC is an inter-process communication technology that allows you to connect, invoke and operate distributed heterogeneous applications as easily as making a local function call. The gRPC protocol is layered over HTTP/2 and It uses Protocol Buffers for marshaling/unmarshaling messages. This makes gRPC, highly efficient on wire and a simple service definition framework.

This Library supports below messaging patterns. For more information on the operations supported, go to The [gRPC Module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/grpc/latest).

- Simple RPC (Unary RPC)
- Server streaming RPC
- Client streaming RPC
- Bidirectional Streaming RPC

For example demonstrations of the usage, go to [Ballerina By Examples](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/).
